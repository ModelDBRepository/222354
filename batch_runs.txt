Documentation for proposed batch runs of build_net_Shep.hoc

The basic idea is to run the network model crircuit and store both the
simulation results and the code that created the stimulation in folder
names like:

run_XXXX
where XXXX is the run number
Timestamps are written at the start and stop of each simulation:
20150611_1228_start
20150611_1330_stop
YYYYMMDD_HHMM_

The tanks will be stored in
tdt2mat_data
as usual.  Spikes for the net will be stored in
tdt2mat_data/more_data

polar plots and raster plots need to be automatically generated.

I think I want to control the batch runs with a program called batch_runs.py
