Test cases for determining maximum firing rate:

light_period = 200
light_gauss_center = 113.33
light_half_width = 30
light_peak_rate = 40

tstop =600

breathing_period = 400
breath_gauss_center = 0
breath_half_width = 100

(noinhib_net)
breath_peak_rate  m1 max fr
200		22.37
400		28.06
450		29.14
475		33.33
482.5		32.30
488.75		30.29
500		36.65
512.5		33.63
525		35.86
550		32.71
600		30.70

From these test runs we can say that the instantaneous max firing rate was 37 Hz.
